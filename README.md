# Euler Project 77
----------------
This works to calculate individual numbers that are plugged in to the equation, but it's way too slow. Definitely needs some refactoring for efficiency.

## Problem

It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:

7 + 3
5 + 5
5 + 3 + 2
3 + 3 + 2 + 2
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five thousand different ways?
